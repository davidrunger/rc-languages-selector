# Rosetta Code Languages Selector

[rosettacode.org][rosettacode] is a great website for comparing
programming languages and/or learning a new language based on others
that you already know. However, for each sample programming task, there
are so many implementations available in different languages that it can
be difficult to sift through the clutter and find the code samples for
the languages that you are focusing on. This extension solves that
problem by only showing code samples for languages that you have
specifically selected.

# Installation

Install through the Google Chrome Web Store:
[Rosetta Code Languages Selector][rcls]

[rcls]: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rosetta-code-languages-se/icjinpkbplhheomciikehmieadoibljg

# Usage

Navigate to any programming Task page at [rosettacode.org][rosettacode].

*Note*: The extension will only be activated on Task pages.

*Bonus tip*: I find that some of the best sample tasks are those that
are most edited. See Rosetta Code's [most revised pages][most-revised].

After the page loads, the extension will inject a box that looks
something like this at the top of the page:

Click the "Select Languages" button to reveal a form that allows you to
select which languages to display.

You can select all/none of the languages using the "Toggle all" button.
Because there are so many languages, it is highly recommended that you
search using the "Filter" input box when toggling any specific language
on or off, rather than scrolling to it.

When you are done selecting your language(s), click "Hide Form" to hide
the form again. Your language preferences will be persisted as you
navigate between programming tasks and also after closing and reopening
the browser.

Enjoy your greatly decluttered Rosetta Code browsing experience. :)
